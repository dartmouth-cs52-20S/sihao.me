This is a personal website project for COSC52-S20@Dartmouth.

The website I was trying to mimic is [monday.com](www.monday.com).

The four main features are all included.

All layouts are done with responsive flexboxes.

There are hover effects for all buttons and content.

screenshot of layout of layout stage can be found under `sc`. I made some text modifications after the screen cap but nothing too structural.

TD
- pure css navbar drop down menu
- smoother transition at more places
- come up with a better design (color scheme, shapes, element arrangments)
- compress the images to speed up the loading
